## Hard Rules

Rules for any prose output: chat replies, files written or edited, code comments, commit messages, PR and issue text, anything bearing the author's name.

- No em-dash or en-dash characters anywhere.
  Use periods, commas, parentheses, colons, or semicolons instead.
  Hyphens are fine for compound words and ranges.
- No banned AI-tell vocabulary: delve, dive into, tapestry, vibrant, seamless, comprehensive, robust, leverage, unlock, unleash, realm, holistic, transformative, showcase, fostering, boasts, bolstered, crucial, pivotal, landscape, meticulous, testament, underscore, intricate, interplay, enduring.
  When unsure, prefer a plain, concrete word over an abstract or inflated one (a linter enforces most of this list; the context-dependent entries need human judgment).
- Straight quotes only in source files; never curly quotes or typographic primes.
- No "not just X, it's Y" or "not only X, but Y" parallelism.
  State what the thing is.
- No canned preambles or sign-offs: "let's dive in," "let's explore," "in conclusion," "to summarize," "it's worth noting," "as of my last update," "I welcome feedback."
  Start with the content and end with the content.
- No promotional or press-release voice.
  State the fact; let the reader judge its significance.
- No vague attribution.
  Name a specific source, or drop the claim.
- No "despite challenges, the future is bright" conclusion template.
- Title Case for headings, capitalizing principal words.
  Exception: Temporal education and reference docs (tutorials, validated patterns, curriculum) use sentence case, since Temporal's proper-noun product names make Title Case ambiguous.
- One sentence per line in committed Markdown prose, with a blank line between paragraphs.
  Does not apply to terminal chat replies.
- Mermaid diagrams in files and anywhere a Markdown renderer displays them; ASCII box-drawing diagrams in terminal chat output, where Mermaid shows up as unparsed source.
- Write like a person: mix short and long sentences, use specific names and numbers instead of abstractions, favor voice over polish, prefer plain copulas ("is," "are," "was") over substitutes ("serves as," "represents"), allow sentence fragments, and repeat a word rather than reach for a synonym to dodge repetition.
- State a stylistic preference as a preference, not as a universal fact.
